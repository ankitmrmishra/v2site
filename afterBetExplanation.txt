afterBet.js contains the code for properly updating pending bets after a bet is placed by the user
@param result, the object returned by placeBet in bet.js

addBet() adds a pending bet to the list of the user's pending bets
refreshData() gets all of the pending bets for the user. 

Some bets, like those in result.showNow, can be added immediately. Right now showNow is always empty.
result.listen can't be added immediately, and is only added after the connection.onAccountChange websocket triggers. 
Both of these situations require information about what the user is betting on from what they clicked
refreshData() doesn't require this

dispatch() likely won't be needed in v2 but in case there is a need to store some sort of state that the bet has been placed, that line shows you that this is the place to store it.
